Ok, so it's the new year, viva 2021! But unlike the vast majority of the internet would have you believe, absolutely nothing has changed.
I'm sure I speak for the vast majority of people when I say that 2020 was a year and a half.
I lost my job due to massive layoffs and couldn't find another, but thankfully my wife had a fairly stable and safe job, so we
were able to weather the year.
I am a self-proclaimed introvert, but due to the lockdowns, I didn't leave my apartment for basically four months, gained a lot of weight, got severely depressed, just generally not a good time.
Discovered photography because it is a very personal hobby. Don't necessarily need to hang out in person with other people who enjoy the hobby, just share your results and knowledge online
So this first post is just going to be an introduction to me, your host, John Purple, and we're going to do a little bit of a Q&A that I have stolen borrowed from other more popular photography people.
